* **Project Management:** Data Cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Business Acumen

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the "Online Retail" dataset from Kaggle, containing transactional data from a UK-based online retailer.

## Methodology
The analysis followed a standard data science project lifecycle:
1.  **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, removed duplicate entries, and converted data types to ensure data integrity.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed statistical analysis to identify top-selling products, high-value customers, and seasonal sales trends.
3.  **Data Visualization:** Created professional plots to visually represent key findings, making them easily understandable for business stakeholders.
4.  **Business Recommendations:** Formulated data-driven recommendations based on the findings to drive business growth.

## Key Findings
* **Seasonal Trends:** Sales revenue peaks significantly in the final two months of the year, driven by the holiday season.
* **Geographic Dominance:** The United Kingdom is the primary market, accounting for a majority of the sales.
* **Customer Segmentation:** A small group of high-value customers contributes a disproportionately large amount of the total revenue.
* **Top Products:** Identified the top-selling products, providing valuable insights for inventory and marketing strategies.

2.  **Develop a Loyalty Program:** Target high-value customers with a dedicated loyalty program to ensure long-term retention.
3.  **Strategic Focus:** Consider using top-selling products for promotional campaigns to increase overall sales volume.

## Project Status
This project is complete and serves as a strong foundation for further analysis, such as customer segmentation or predictive modeling.
